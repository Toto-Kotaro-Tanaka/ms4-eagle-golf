# Eagle Golf <a name="top"></a>

This is an e-commerce website for golf products that I create for **Milestone Project 4 (Full Stack Frameworks with Django)** in [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), Ireland. The use of the website is for educational purpose only, however, all the functionalities work as if it is an actual e-commerce website. It is a mobile responsive website and the link to the website is available HERE. <!-- Live Site Link here -->

## UX 5 PLANES

### Strategy Plane

The primary goal of the web is to give users (= shoppers) a hassles free shopping experience. Below are the user's and owner's stories, which have some important features and functions to achieve the primary goal, and these are all implemented on the website. *(On a scale of 1 [least] - 5 [most])

Below are the additional features and functions that can improve the website, however, these are not mandatory to achieve the current goal. Some are not implemented due to a lack of my current skills & knowledge and some due to a lack of time.
