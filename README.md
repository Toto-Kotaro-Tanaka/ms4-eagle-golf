# Eagle Golf <a name="top"></a>

This is an e-commerce website for golf products that I create for **Milestone Project 4 (Full Stack Frameworks with Django)** in [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/), Ireland. The use of the website is for educational purpose only, however, all the functionalities work as if it is an actual e-commerce website. It is a mobile responsive website and the link to the website is available HERE. <!-- Live Site Link here -->

<!-- Mock up goes here -->

## USER STORIES

There are two types of users for the website. One is shoppers whose primary goal is to view golf products and purchase them online. The other one is the shop owner whose primary goal is to sell golf products and run business. I am a full-stack web developer and create an e-commerce website to meet the primary goals of the users and their stories.

## UX 5 PLANES

### Strategy Plane

To achieve the user's primary goals and stories outlined in the User Stories section, all the functions and features on the tables below are minimum requirements and they are implemented in the website. (On a scale of 1 [least] - 5 [most])

Below are the additional functions and features that can improve the website, however, these are not mandatory to achieve the current user goals and stories. Some are not implemented due to a lack of my current skills & knowledge and some due to a lack of time.

| Opportunity                                     | Importance | Viability / Feasibility |

Below is the flowchart of the website to show the core relationships between the pages. (Most of the pages are linked each other subject to permission)<br>

![image](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/ux/front-end-chart.png)<br>

— **Back-end** —<br>

Users have options to purchase products as a guest user or account holder user. Guest users cannot save personal details for their next purchase so personal details such as name, email address, shipping address etc belong to their order in the database. Account holder users create an account with their <ins>email address</ins> and <ins>username</ins>, and user name (user profile) is linked with their order so that personal details can be retrieved. Each product belongs to a category and that is identified by category id. Each order is linked with product sku and name.<br>
SQLite, which is Django built-in database is used for development mode and Heroku Postgre is used for production mode. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is used to hold all static files and folders for the website for production mode. 

Below is the chart of the database to show the data relationships.
