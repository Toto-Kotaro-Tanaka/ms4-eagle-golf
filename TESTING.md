### Html

‚Äî **Code Validation** ‚Äî

As the HTML code is completed on all HTML files, a code validation test is carried out by using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), which is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium that allows checking HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed markup, to check any warnings and errors.

**Home Page** (`index.html`): [10 Errors & 5 Warnings] *Some duplicated errors and warning and they are not repeated below

1. Error: Element `hr` not allowed as child of element `ul` in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solve the error by putting `hr` in `<li>`

‚Äî **Form Validation** ‚Äî

There are some forms on the website. Some of them are validated by front-end (e.g. @ mark for email input) and some by back-end (e.g. existing user name). Manual test is carried out to see if the validations as well as form functions work properly.

**Search Form**

The form takes any texts including special characters (e.g. ¬£, @, [ etc) so there is no form validation for this and the search is processed when search button is clicked as long as there is a text in the input box. It works fine [when a key word exists in product names or descriptions](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/search-form.png), and when it does not it shows 0 result. [When there is no text in the input field, then it displays an error message](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/search-form-empty.png). The search function is available on all the pages and it works from anywhere on the page.

**Subscribe To Newsletter Form**

The form is available on all the pages on the website so try to submit an email from a few different pages to make sure it works. All the emails are submitted from any pages and saved in the database so [it works fine](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/subscribe-newsletters-success.png). If the email has no @ mark, it gives a warning message that @ mark must be included. There should not be duplicated emails in the system so if the email address already exists, [it displays an error message](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/subscribe-newsletters-error.png). 

**Register and Login Forms**

Users must be unique so if email address or username already exits in the database, [it displays an error message for register page](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/register-form-email.png). Also, when the passwords do not match, [it displays an error message](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/register-form-password.png). This is similar for login page that if email or user name does not exists in the database, [it displays an error message and if password is incorrect, it also displays an error message](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/login-form.png).

**Add Product, Checkout and Stripe Form**

When mandatory fields are not filled in or form is invalid, [it displays an error message](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/add-product-form.png). For credit card details, it is validated by Stripe and if it is invalid details, [it displays an error message](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/stripe-form.png).

*Based on the manual test, all the forms on the webiste work properly*

### Css

‚Äî **Code Validation** ‚Äî

As the CSS code is completed, a code validation test is carried out by using [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), which is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium that allows checking Cascading Style Sheets, to make sure that CSS complies with the standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium.

**`base.css`, `cart.css`, `checkout.css`, `index.css`, `products.css` and `profile.css`** are tested and there are [no errors on any of CSS files](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/css-validation.png).

- There are some [warnings](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/css-warnings.png) related to WebKit, which is one of [web browser rendering engines](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3468154/what-is-webkit-and-how-is-it-related-to-css), for base.css, index.css and product.css. By looking at the [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52490004/what-are-all-of-these-w3c-css-validation-warnings-about) post and a [Code Institue Slack](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/css-webkit.png) threads, no further actions are required so decide to leave as it is

### JavaScript

‚Äî **Code Validation** ‚Äî

As the JavaScript code is completed, a code validation test is carried out by using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/), which is a static code analysis tool used in software development for checking if JavaScript source code complies with coding rules.

**`quantity_input_script.html`** (js code in cart app), **`stripe_elements.js`**, **`quantity_input_script.html`** (js code in product app), **`countryfield.js`** and js script on **`cart.html`** are tested. There is a warning of `'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).` so solve the warning by putting `/*jshint esversion: 6 */`. `$` shows on all the files as undefined variable but this is jQuery symbol so can be ignored. `Stripe` on `stripe_elements.js` shows as undefined variable but this comes from Stripe document so it can be ignored

### Python

‚Äî **Functions** ‚Äî

There are some functionalities, which are run by `views.py` file in each app (in some case by `contexts.py`), on the website. Manual test is carried out to see if these functions work as expected.

**cart App:**

- View Cart: Products in the cart can be viewed by clicking the cart icon or a process your order button &#10004;
- Add Cart: Products can be added from the product page by clicking an add to shopping cart button. If the same product has different sizes (and right or left for golf clubs), they are added separately &#10004;
- Adjust Cart: Products can be adjusted in the cart. Change the quantity of the product and remove it &#10004;
- Special Offer: Free Golf Balls appear for any order ‚Ç¨250 or more. This is not run by `views.py` but should work when total purchase is ‚Ç¨250 or more &#10004;
- Display: Price per product, discount price and total value inluding shipping cost show based on the products in the cart &#10004;

**checkout App:**

- Checkout: Checkout is done by completing the form & credit card details and clicking a complete order button. Products in the cart can be views by clicking the cart icon or a process your order button &#10004;
- Checkout Success: When the order is completed, it creates an order in the database and save the info. It also shows checkout success page for users &#10004;
- Confirmation email: When the order is successed (means payment in Stripe goes through), confirmation email is sent &#10004;
- Stripe: When the order is completed, it creates a record of [payment_intent, charge.succeeded and payment_intent.succeeded](https://github.com/Toto-Kotaro-Tanaka/ms4-eagle-golf/blob/master/readme/testing/stripe-function.png) &#10004;

**home App:**

- Subscribe to our newsletter: When a unique and valid email is submitted, it saves in the database with Subscribed = True status &#10004;

**products App:**

- Product Display: Products are displayed by... group of categories, category, brand, sale products and all products. They can be sorted by price, category and product name both ascending and descending. Products can be searched by a key word &#10004;
- Product Details Display: Product details can be viewed by clicking an image of the product. It displays product category, ID, description, price, size (if applicable), discount price (applicable) &#10004;
- Product Add, Edit and Delete: Only authorised user (admin) is allowed to do these &#10004;

**profile App:**

- Profile: Access to profile page where users can update the personal details and access to the order history &#10004;

‚Äî **Code Validation** ‚Äî

As Python code is completed, a code validation test is carried out by using [PEP8 &#40;Python Enhancement Proposal&#41; online](http://pep8online.com) to see if the code meets guidelines and best practices for the readability and consistency of Python code.

Below is the list of `py` files that are customised therefore checked by the validator.

**eagle-golf Product**

- `asgi.py`, `settings.py`, `urls.py` and `wsgi.py`: Line too long <!-- Check the long lines on settings.py -->

**cart App**

- `apps.py`, `contexts.py`, `urls.py` and `views.py`: There are *trailing whitespace*, *two blank lines*, *no newline at end of file*, *line too long* warnings and errors, and they are all fixed.

**checkout App**

- `init.py`, `admin.py`, `apps.py`, `forms.py`, `models.py`, `signals.py`, `urls.py`, `views.py`, `webhook_handler.py` and `webhooks.py`: There are *no newline at end of file*, *trailing whitespace*, *line too long*, *too many blank lines*, *at least two spaces before inline comment*, *expected 2 blank lines*, *blank line contains whitespace* warnings and errors and they are all fixed <!-- Except some too long lines as TBC -->

**home App**

- `admin.py`, `apps.py`, `contexts.py`, `forms.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py` and `views.py`: There are *trailing whitespace*, *no newline at end of file* and *line too long* warnings and errors and they are all fixed <!-- Except some too long lines as TBC -->

**products App**

- `admin.py`, `apps.py`, `forms.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py`, `views.py` and `widgits.py`: There are *no newline at end of file*, *line too long*, *blank line contains whitespace* warnings and errors and they are all fixed <!-- Except some too long lines as TBC -->

**profiles App**

- `apps.py`, `forms.py`, `models.py`, `urls.py`, and `views.py`: There are *no newline at end of file*, *line too long* and *trailing whitespace* warnings and errors and they are all fixed

### Web Browser

‚Äî **Visibilities and functionalities** ‚Äî

The website is available on the major web browsers, such as **Chrome**, **Safari**, **Firefox**, **Opera** and **Microsoft Edge**. To make sure all the visual contents are shown and functions work properly on those browsers, the below tests are carried out on all of them. *Except Chrom that is used to build the website

1. Open the website on the browser to do a visual test. Look at all the pages to see if everything appears as expected (both desktop and mobile sizes)
2. Try all the functions outlined on the Python Functions test
